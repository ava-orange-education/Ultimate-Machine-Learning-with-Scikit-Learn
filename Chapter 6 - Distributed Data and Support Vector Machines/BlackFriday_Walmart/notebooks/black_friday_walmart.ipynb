    "1. **Maximize Revenue:** Increase overall sales and revenue during the Black Friday event.\n",
    "2. **Customer Segmentation:** Understand the diverse customer base and tailor marketing strategies for different segments.\n",
    "3. **Product Strategy:** Identify popular products and product categories to optimize inventory and promotions.\n",
    "4. **Demographic Insights:** Analyze customer demographics to customize marketing messages and offerings.\n",
    "5. **Promotional Effectiveness:** Evaluate the effectiveness of past promotions and identify areas for improvement.\n",

    "# Key Questions to Address\n",
    "1. **Product Insights:**\n",
    "   - Which products and categories are most popular during Black Friday?\n",
    "   - Are there particular products that consistently drive high sales?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Demographic Analysis:**\n",
    "   - How do age, gender, occupation, marital status, and city category impact purchasing behavior?\n",
    "   - Can customer segments be identified for targeted marketing?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **City and Region Analysis:**\n",
    "   - Are sales concentrated in specific cities or regions (City_Category)?\n",
    "   - Do customers who have stayed longer in a city exhibit different purchasing patterns?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Promotional Strategies:**\n",
    "   - What promotions or discounts have been most effective in driving sales?\n",
    "   - Can personalized promotions be designed based on customer characteristics?\n",

    "# Approach\n",
    "1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conduct a thorough exploration of the dataset to understand its characteristics and uncover initial insights.\n",
    "2. **Customer Segmentation:** Use clustering or grouping techniques to identify distinct customer segments based on demographics and purchasing behavior.\n",

On average, males tend to spend more on purchases compared to females, as evidenced by the average amounts spent: 9,25,408.28 for males and 7,12,217.18 for females.\n",

    "Combining Purchase and Marital_Status for analysis (60% single, 40% married), it was found that single men tend to spend the most during Black Friday. This also suggests that men generally reduce their spending once they are married, possibly due to added responsibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting observation was made in the Stay_In_Current_City_Years column, revealing that people who have spent 1 year in the city tend to spend the most. This trend is understandable, as those who have spent more than 4 years in the city are usually well settled and less inclined to make new purchases compared to newcomers (35% staying for 1 year, 18% for 2 years, 17% for 3 years).\n",
    "\n",
